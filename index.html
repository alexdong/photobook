                    You were quiet after the first check up. 48 hours after the water broke, Sally suggested induction of labour to minimise the risk of infection. Mum was checked into the Queen's Hospital maternity ward around 6:30 on the 18th so that "she had plenty of time to give birth to you. " Mum spent the whole day waiting, but there was no sign of you coming.

                    After some decent dose of hormone gel, the contraction started the next morning. By the late afternoon, the pain was finally in full swing. However, it took forever for mom to get to even a 1-cm dilation. We tried the hot SPA and walked around to help with the dilation.

                    We struggled with your sleep in the early months. First, we tried to put you in the little bassinet Aldo gave us. We can take it everywhere we go so it was quite convenient but apparently you didn't like it.

                    Then we tried this little bed. The theory goes that the strings that hang the little mattress will swing gently as you wriggle around, which would help with self-soothing. No, you weren't keen either.
